Oracle Exadata Cloud @ Customer  @ York University

Since Last year October first Exdata C@C X8-2 arrived at York, we've been busy on Exadata C@C. 

Exadata Cloud @ Customer (ExaCC) runs the same hardware and software as on-premises Exadata Database Machine. 

More and more Oracle database customers started moving their legacy Oracle database  systems onto Oracle Cloud. York Universy is heavily using Oracle database and PeopleSoft HCM, PeopleSoft Financial. Following the track of "[**McMaster University**]( https://blogs.oracle.com/infrastructure/scaling-in-a-crisis:-how-mcmaster-university-keeps-up-with-student-demand)"

It makes life so easy to just clone a database.

```shell
dbaascli pdb remote_clone --pdbname TESTPDB --source SCDB
```

Now we have 2 quarter rack X8-2 machines and 4 VM clusters running.
